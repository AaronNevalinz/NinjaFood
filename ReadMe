# Explanation

use the command
'npm run [whatever the script file name ie 'build-css']'

```
npm run build css
```
Here tailwind is gonna process the file and output it in public/styles.css file

Using npm install a live server, that will always have your project running and also detects and refreshes any changes on the project

```
npm install live-server -g
```

creating a tailwind config file

```
npx tailwindcss init --full
```
the `--full` flag creates a config file with all the default values that tailwind uses

Every time a customized value is entered in the `tailwind.config.js` file or the file is updated, you need to reprocess the `src/styles.css` file because it wouldn't be having the updated values and if you are to use the customized values in your html; it won't work

To reprocess this, run: 'Make sure you are in the correct directory where the `package.json` file is located...
```
npm run build-css
```
This is the previous script in the `package.json` file

Note: this is not a good practise to change default values in the default `tailwind.config.js` file.
A better option is to create a blank config file and enter the customised values. 

To do this run:
```
npx tailwindcss init
```
Note: After Changes are made, you will need to rebuild or reprocess your `src/styles.css`

Note: The created config file comes with some default values. The Customized values are created in the `extend` object.
